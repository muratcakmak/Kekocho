### Auth

Authentication part of the app has two separate parts.

#### Backend Authentication
  It is controlled by the Ruby on Rails framework which provides powerful libraries and secure environment. Encryption library BCrypt is repsonsible for the creation of session tokens whenever a user attempts to login. This session token is stored in the browser as well as the backend.

#### Frontend Authentication
  ```react-router-dom``` is a wrapper that controls the React routes. Using rails' application.html.erb file Kekocho allows a user's session to persist. 

####  Technologies:
    - Ruby on Rails
    - React
    - Redux

### Model Layer

  In Quora, a user has many questions. Questions have many answers and topics. Answers have many comments and belong to a particular question. A comment belongs to an answer and a topic has many questions.

  Topic and question relationship is established by a join table called topicQuestions. question_ids and corresponding topic_ids are stored on the table.

  When a user wants to create a topic while editing a question, the request hits the question_topic_controller. The controller checks whether the topic already exists, and grabs the question_id and creates a question_topic record on the table. With the aid of rails's ```inverse_of``` association, the backend is able to operate fluidly and consistently.

#### Technologies:
    - Postgresql
    - Ruby on Rails
